<h1> CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION  </h1>
<H2> Overview</H2>
In the competitive telecommunications industry, customer churn - where customers become inactive and stop purchasing services - is a significant challenge.  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of customer churn, helping the company to proactively retain its customer base.
We also aim to access the likelihood of customers becoming inactive and discontinuing their purchase of airtime and data for a period of 90 days. 
By leveraging customer data, the model will identify customers at risk of churning, enabling the company to implement targeted retention strategies and interventions.
